= SPEC-1: Kito Programming Language \:sectnums: \:toc:

== Background

Kito is a new programming language designed to bridge the gap between Python’s extensive ecosystem and the strong functional programming paradigms found in ML-family languages such as OCaml or F#.

The core motivation behind Kito is to provide developers — particularly data scientists, machine learning engineers, and backend developers — with a language that offers:

- Seamless interoperability with Python libraries, particularly in scientific computing and machine learning.
- A modern, functional syntax with type inference, immutability by default, and pattern matching.
- Compile-time metaprogramming capabilities inspired by Zig’s `comptime`, enabling generation of types, validation, and high-performance specialized code paths at compile time.

By compiling directly to CPython VM bytecode, Kito aims to be a first-class citizen within Python ecosystems, allowing developers to mix and match Kito and Python codebases without friction.

== Requirements

The following requirements define the initial scope and expectations for Kito’s design and implementation:

=== Must Have

- Functional programming language with syntax inspired by ML-family languages (OCaml, F#).
- Seamless interoperability with Python, including:
  - Direct invocation of Python functions and classes.
  - Importing and using Python standard library modules.
  - Calling Kito functions from Python.
- Compilation target: CPython VM bytecode (Python 3.12+).
- Static type system with strong type inference.
- Compile-time metaprogramming system (`const`) allowing:
  - Type generation.
  - Compile-time computations and validations.
  - Performance optimizations via specialization.
- Both mutable and immutable data structures, similar to F#.
- Ability to produce:
  - Standalone executables embedding CPython.
  - Importable modules that can be used directly in Python scripts.

=== Should Have

- Pattern matching as a first-class language feature.
- Expression-based syntax with minimal ceremony.
- Comprehensive standard library, particularly for:
  - Collections and functional utilities.
  - Interoperability helpers for Python bridging.
- Tooling support for:
  - Language Server Protocol (LSP).
  - Formatter and static analyzer.

=== Could Have

- Optional tooling for automatic conversion of Python functions to Kito stubs.
- Interactive REPL with Python compatibility.

=== Won’t Have (for initial MVP)

- Marking pure functions or enforcing purity at language level.
- Runtime environment independent of CPython (no separate Kito VM).

== Method

=== Language Syntax and Semantics

Kito's syntax blends elements of ML-family languages with pragmatic features aimed at mixed-functional and interop-friendly programming. The core syntax principles are:

- Function definitions use `fn`, with **braces for blocks**.
- Pattern matching is a first-class control structure.
- UFCS (Uniform Function Call Syntax) allows calling methods in both `func(obj, arg)` and `obj.func(arg)` styles.
- **Partial application using underscores (**\`\`**)** allows creating function stubs without full currying.

Example:

```kito
// Function definition
let add = fn (x: int, y: int) -> int {
    x + y
}

// Partial application
let addFive = add(5, _)

let result = addFive(3)

// Pattern matching
match result {
    8 -> print("Correct!")
    _ -> print("Unexpected result: {}", result)
}

// UFCS example
"Hello".replace("H", "J") // equivalent to replace("Hello", "H", "J")
```

- **Functions are values**, allowing first-class functional composition.
- **Expressions return values**, even from control structures.
- **Mutable and immutable variables coexist**, similar to F#'s `let` (immutable) and `mutable` for mutables.

```kito
let x = 10   // immutable
mutable y = 20   // mutable

y = y + 1    // valid mutation
```

- **Modules map directly to Python modules**, enabling seamless interop with Python.

=== Python Interop and Data Model

- **Automatic Type Coercion:** Kito’s core types (list, dict, set, string, int, float, bool) automatically convert to and from their Python equivalents.

- **Direct Module Imports:** Python modules can be imported directly into Kito code using the standard `import` syntax.

- **Direct Object Access:** Python objects behave like Kito objects for attribute and method access.

- **Functions are Interchangeable:** Python and Kito functions share a compatible calling convention.

- **Python Exceptions:** Propagated into Kito exceptions.

- **Duck Typing for Python:** Dynamic attributes on Python objects are accessible in Kito.

=== Compile-Time (const) System

Kito provides a `const` system for compile-time metaprogramming, allowing:

- Compile-time evaluation of blocks and functions.
- Python execution and module introspection during compilation.
- Generation of types and functions.
- Performance optimizations via static dispatch and unrolling.
